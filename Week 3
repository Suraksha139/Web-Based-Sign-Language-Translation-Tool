Week 3 -  Requirement analysis 
The requirement analysis for the Web-Based Sign Language Translation Tool focused on identifying all the essential functional and non-functional needs required to build a reliable, accurate, and user-friendly system.
The first requirement was the ability to capture live hand gestures through a webcam, which meant the system needed browser camera access and stable video processing. 
The next requirement was extracting hand landmarks in real time, which led to selecting MediaPipe Hands as the primary framework due to its speed and accuracy. 
Another major requirement was developing a machine learning model capable of recognizing numeric sign gestures, so the project needed a properly collected dataset, preprocessing scripts, and a model-conversion system to export it into TensorFlow Lite for web deployment.
On the functional side, the system required modules for gesture capture, landmark extraction, prediction display, and smooth integration between frontend and backend. 
A clear requirement was that the tool must show predictions instantly, without delays, making real-time performance a priority.
The web interface needed to be simple, responsive, and accessible to all users, including those with no technical background.
On the non-functional side, the system had to be lightweight, fast, secure, and capable of running directly in a browser without external installations.
Requirements also included cross-device compatibility, low latency, and stable accuracy under different lighting conditions. 
By analyzing these needs, the project gained a complete understanding of what components, technologies, and design strategies would be essential for building an efficient and practical sign language translation tool.
