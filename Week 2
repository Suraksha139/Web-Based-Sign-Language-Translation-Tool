WEEK 2 – Literature Survey Review and Research Gap Identification

Week 2 was completely dedicated to conducting an extensive literature survey.
The team reviewed more than 13 research papers from IEEE, Elsevier, and other journals that covered topics like real-time sign language recognition, CNN-based gesture classification, MediaPipe hand landmark detection, and deep learning models such as LSTM and Transformers.
Each paper was summarized to understand existing approaches, datasets used, accuracy achieved, and technological challenges.
Through this survey, we identified that most existing systems either supported static gestures only or required specialized hardware like Kinect sensors or gloves.
There were very few web-based real-time translation tools.
This helped us identify a clear research gap—the need for a fully web-based, real-time, camera-driven Indian Sign Language (ISL) translator accessible without installing any software.
The literature survey strengthened our foundation for the project.
