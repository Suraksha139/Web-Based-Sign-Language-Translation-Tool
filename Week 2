WEEK 2 – Refinement of the objectives 
During this week, the main focus was on refining and finalizing the objectives of the Web-Based Sign Language Translation Tool.
The initial objectives drafted earlier were broad, so we carefully analyzed each one to make them more specific, realistic, and aligned with the overall project scope.
We reviewed the technical requirements, the available tools, and the expected outcomes to ensure that the objectives were achievable within the project duration.
The refinement involved rewriting vague statements into clear targets such as preparing a structured dataset, training a reliable gesture-recognition model, enabling real-time prediction, and designing a user-friendly web interface.
We also separated core objectives from long-term enhancements to avoid scope expansion. 
The refined objectives were organized in a logical sequence so that development could progress smoothly from data collection to deployment.
By the end of the week, we finalized a well-defined set of objectives that would guide every stage of the system’s development with clarity and purpose.
