WEEK 1 – Literature Survey Completion & Refinement of Objectives
Day 1 – Detailed Literature Review Compilation
Collected previous research papers related to Sign Language Recognition, MediaPipe, TensorFlow Models, CNN/LSTM techniques, and gesture recognition.
Organized research papers year-wise and author-wise for easy referencing.
Highlighted limitations of each paper such as low accuracy in dynamic signs, lighting sensitivity, requirement for costly sensors or gloves.
Day 2 – Identification of Gaps in Existing Studies
Compared all related works based on parameters like accuracy, speed, model complexity, real-time ability, cost, and usability.
Identified key gaps:
Limited support for web-based real-time translation tools.
Many systems support only one-way translation.
Day 3 – Refinement of Project Objectives
Re-wrote the objectives more clearly and aligned them with the problem statement:
Refined Objectives:
Develop a real-time sign language recognition system using MediaPipe and TensorFlow.
Create a custom dataset of hand landmarks for numeric gestures (0–9).
Train and optimize a deep-learning model with high accuracy.
Day 4 – Verification of Literature Survey & Objectives
Cross-checked the literature summary with research references.
Ensured objectives match the project scope and technology stack.
Day 5 – Final Documentation of Week 1 Work
Drafted the complete Literature Survey (Phase–1) in refined format.
Finalized the Revision of Objective Section.
Added gap analysis, comparison tables, and citations.
