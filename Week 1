WEEK 1 – Project Introduction, Problem Analysis & Concept Finalization
During the first week, the primary focus was on understanding the motivation behind developing a Web-Based Sign Language Translation Tool.
The team explored the communication challenges faced by Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially the difficulty in accessing written reports, online content, academic materials, and spoken communication.
We studied how sign language remains the most expressive medium for DHH individuals but is not always accessible due to the dependency on human interpreters.
After several discussions, the project title and aim were finalized—to design a web platform capable of translating sign gestures into text/speech and written text into sign sequences.
The week also included studying the importance of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning in enabling sign recognition.
By the end of the week, the project scope, target users, and major objectives were clearly defined.
